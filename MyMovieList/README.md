# My Movie List

This is a practice project from the [React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) I took.

This app allows users to search movies by name, see the IMDB information, assign score and save the movie as watched list in the local browser. The data is from [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

Through this project, I learnt

- Using `useEffect` hook to access data from APIs
- Creating custom hooks to reuse logics and promote clean code
- Utilizing browser's local storage to persist data and improve user experience

Based on the course content, I explored more topics and completed the following items by myself,

- Refactoring for better readibility
- Storing and accessing API keys as environment variables
- Deployment to the live Internet environment
