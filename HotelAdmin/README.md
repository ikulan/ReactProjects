# Hotel Admin App

This is a practice project from the [React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) I took.

This Single-Page Application offers a rich set of features and a polished interface for hotel administration, including booking management, cabin management, and user management.

Work In Progress.
